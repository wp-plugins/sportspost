Enhance your sports posts with rich, detailed metadata about games, teams, and players.

== Description ==

Enhance your sports posts with rich, detailed metadata about games, teams, and players, and with live game photos.

SportsPost 1.0 allows bloggers to search for player names of athletes in major North American sports leagues, and drop their names directly into their post. These names can then hyperlink to externally hosted Player Profile pages, with expanded news, statistics, and photos of those players.

Future versions will allow bloggers to:

* Search, download, and include live, editorially licensed sports photos taken from recent sporting events
* Identify their posts as being Game Previews or Game Recaps for particular sporting events, and include in the metadata of those posts the unique Game ID
